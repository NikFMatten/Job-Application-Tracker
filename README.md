<h2>Description</h2><hr>
<p>An application to designed to help users keep track of applied jobs. This application enables the user to input information from a job listing and have all jobs easily tracked and accessible. If an applied job reaches an age of 30+ days old, it automatically moves to a seperate column in order to keep more organization. The user is also able to mark an applied job as "Interviewing" and moves to a seperate column. Finally, users are also able to mark a job as "Archive" and will be moved to a seperate column, for the purpose of still having access to the job at a later date, if necessary.</p>
